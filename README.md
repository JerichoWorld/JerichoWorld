# JerichoWorld Dataset

Dataset corresponding to the paper Modeling Worlds in Text found here https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y1YtS9MZA75.

## Dataset Organization
* ```data/train.json```: The main dataset file containing a list of training examples.
* ```data/test.json```: The main dataset file containing a list of test examples.

The dataset is organized as:

```
{
"rom": "zork1",
"state": state,
"next_state": next_state,
"action": act,
"reward": rew,
}
```
Where `state` and `next_state` are two subsequent states with `act` being the corresponding action and `rew` being the corresponding reward. The rom names vary based on what is defined in the paper.

## Example of a state:

## Fields
Each example defines the following fields:
* **rom**: Name of the game that generated this example.
* **obs**: Narrative text returned by the game as a result of the last action.
* **loc_desc**: Text returned by *look* command from current location.
* **inv_desc**: Text returned by *inventory* command from current step.
* **inv_objs**: Dictionary of ```{obj_description : [obj_names]}``` containing detected objects in the player's inventory.
* **surrounding_objs**: Dictionary of ```{obj_description : [obj_names]}``` containing detected objects in the player's immediate surroundings.
* **score**: Current game score at this step.
* **location**: Name and number for the world-object corresponding to the player's current location.
* **state**: Path to pickle file containing saved game state.
* **walkthrough_act**: Action taken by the data collection agent from the current state.
* **walkthrough_diff**: ```world_diff``` corresponding to taking the taken action.
* **valid_acts**: list of ```world_diff : action_str```. The important part here is the world_diff since there are many action strings that can result in the same world diff.
* **graph**: list of lists of ```subject, relation, object``` of knowledge graph for current step

## Current Tasks
* **Predict knowledge graphs**: Given the current observations and graph can we predict some/all of the next knowledge graph? Ground truth given by in ```graph```.
* **Predict valid actions**: Given a the current observations and graph can we predict some/all of the valid actions? Ground truth given by world-diffs in ```valid_acts```.
